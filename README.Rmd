## *iStructureMetaco*: an R package for the analysis of the internal structure of metacommunities

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of 'iStructureMetaco' is to provide functions to simulate metacommunities using a process-based colonization-extinction model. This package also provides wrapper functions to use Joint Species Distribution Models from the package [HMSC](https://github.com/guiblanchet/HMSC) (Guillaume, 2019). All functions and analysis provided as examples are associated to our publication 'The Internal Structure of Metacommunities' (Leibold, et.al. 2021).

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/javirudolph/iStructureMetaco) with:

``` r
